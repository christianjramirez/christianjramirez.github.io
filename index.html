    <h1>Why Selvedge is cool.</h1>
    <p> <strong>Selvedge</strong> denim pants are very sought after in the fashion community because Selvedge denim is intrinsically more <strong>labor-intensive</strong> and expensive to produce, as it requires more time and attention to detail than is typically found in non-selvedge denim production. Manufacturers of selvedge typically also invest in better quality yarn and dye, resulting in a superior final product. <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a></p>
